# My NixOS configurations

Here's my NixOS/home-manager config files. Requires [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

**Highlights**:

- Deployment **secrets** using **sops-nix**
- Flexible **Home Manager** Configs through **feature flags**



## How to bootstrap

All you need is nix (any version). Run:
```
nix-shell
```

If you already have nix 2.4+, git, and have already enabled `flakes` and
`nix-command`, you can also use the non-legacy command:
```
nix develop
```

`nixos-rebuild --flake .` To build system configurations

`home-manager --flake .` To build user configurations

`nix build` (or shell or run) To build and use packages

`sops` To manage secrets


## Secrets

For deployment secrets (such as user passwords and server service secrets), I'm
using the awesome [`sops-nix`](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix). All secrets
are encrypted with my personal PGP key (stored on a YubiKey), as well as the
relevant systems's SSH host keys.

On my desktop and laptop, I use `pass` for managing passwords, which are
encrypted using (you bet) my PGP key. This same key is also used for mail
signing, as well as for SSH'ing around.
